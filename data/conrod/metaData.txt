Its neck is long and cylindrical and its facial features are rendered in relief. The figure wears a similar miniature figure around its neck. It has been suggested that the posture of cruciform pendants could be representing birthing and that these objects may have been worn as personal talismans by females throughout their life and even to their death, since they are also found as grave goods in Chalcolithic pit graves"
